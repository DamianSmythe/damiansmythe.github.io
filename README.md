Intro

Iceland in a small Nordic island with only 103,000kmâ‚‚ a coast line of 4,970 km and a highest point of 2,119km above sea level, Iceland lies right on seam between two tectonic plates which makes the country rather prone to  earth quakes and to volcanoes 


Why?
Iceland sits on top of a tectonic plate seam meaning that its split down the middle, half on one plate and half on the other plate on the mid Atlantic Ridge. This means that it will be far more lightly for Iceland to have an epicenter close to the center of the island as the seam runs through the center. These plates are convergent and are separating at about 2cm a year, this means that magma can seep up into the void that is being created as the two plates seperate
